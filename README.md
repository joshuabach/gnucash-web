GnuCash Web
===========

*GnuCash Web* is a simple, easy to use, mobile-friendly web interface for
[GnuCash](https://gnucash.org/) intended for self-hosting. It can access a single
GnuCash-Database in [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html),
[postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/de/) (including
[mariadb](https://mariadb.org/)) format using the great
[piecash](https://pypi.org/project/piecash/) GnuCash library for Python.

Development status should be considered at most *Beta*, see [below](#Contributing) for
more information.

Check out the [demo](https://gnucash-web-demo.bachmeier.cc)!

Features
--------

The primary use case for *GnuCash Web* is adding simple two-split transactions on the
go, e.g. to record a cash expense when buying a coffee.

Key features include:

- Browse account hierarchy
- View transaction history and balance for an account
- Add and edit two-split transactions, delete transactions
- Recycle commonly used transactions
- Simple single-user authentication
- Ease of use, especially on mobile
- CLI to update the price database

Core Technology Stack
---------------------

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [piecash](https://pypi.org/project/piecash/) for accessing GnuCash database
- [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) web framework
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for front end design

Installation
------------

*GnuCash Web* is [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/GnuCash-Web/), so you can
simply install it via `pip install GnuCash-Web`. Additionally, you may need to install
`mysql` or `psycopg2`, depending on which back end you want to use (sqlite back end is
included in the python standard library).

Note that at least Python 3.8 is required.

You also need to setup a database that stores the GnuCash data, see
[below](#initialising-database) for more information. Mind that you will likely need
to be able to access the database directly from your desktop/notebook with the
official GnuCash desktop app, since *GnuCash Web* is only a companion and not
intended to be used on its own. If your database is not publicly accessible, using an
[SSH Tunnel](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/tunneling) is an easy and secure way to
access it remotely.

Usage
-----

*GnuCash Web* is aimed at system administrators, but is otherwise easy to set up.

### Configuration

Create a config file in `/etc/gnucash_web/config.py` or in
`~/.config/gnucash_web/config.py`.  If both files are present, values from the latter
override those from the former.  Set the environment variable `GNUCASH_WEB_CONFIG` to load
a different config file. If set, no other config files are read.

The config file is a python script. The following example illustrates possible values for
all available options. This is the normal Flask configuration file, so all [standard
configuration
variables](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/config/#builtin-configuration-values)
can also be set. All options have [default values](gnucash_web/config/default.py), but you 
should at least set `SECRET_KEY` and `DB_NAME`.

```python
import logging

# A 32-bit-key used e.g. to encrypt the session cookie or for other cryptographic operations
# Use e.g. `from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes; print(get_random_bytes(32))`
SECRET_KEY = 'please use something thats actually safe'

# Python standard library log level
LOG_LEVEL = logging.WARN

# Supported values: 'sqlite', 'mysql' or 'postgres'
DB_DRIVER = 'mysql'

# Host name of the database (ignored for DB_DRIVER = 'sqlite')
DB_HOST = 'database.example.org'

# Name of the Database on the host (for DB_DRIVER = 'sqlite', this is the 'path/to/db.sqlite')
DB_NAME = 'gnucash_data'

# Supported values: None, 'passthrough'. See below for details.
AUTH_MECHANISM = None

# The maximum number of transactions per page in the ledger
TRANSACTION_PAGE_LENGTH = 25

# Name of the account to be preselected when creating new transactions (optional)
PRESELECTED_CONTRA_ACCOUNT = 'Example:Account'
```

### Running

It is not recommended to use the builtin Flask web server in production. *GnuCash Web*
comes as a [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) application, so there are [many
options](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/deploying/) available to run it.

Most WSGI web server require setting a "module", which is the WSGI object that runs the
app. For *GnuCash Web*, this is `gnucash_web.wsgi:app`.

For example, the following `.ini`-file might be used as a config for
[uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

```ini
[uwsgi]
module = gnucash_web.wsgi:app
pidfile = gnucash_web.pid
master = true
processes = 1
http-socket = :8080
chmod-socket = 660
vacuum = true
```

#### Docker

*GnuCash Web* can be run using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), either using the published 
[packages](https://github.com/joshuabach/gnucash-web/packages), DockerFile, or using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) 
with the provided sample `docker-compose.yml` files. This uses a simple SQLite backend, 
though if you want to use a dedicated database backend then `docker-compose-postgres.yml`
is also provided, running [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the name implies.

In either case, configuration is done via environment variables in the compose file instead
of the default configuration file. The same options are available.

If you're running a dedicated backend as part of docker compose, then in order to 
[initialise the database](#initialising-database) you'll need to 
[expose the respective ports](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/).
Keep security in mind when exposing ports, such as using a strong password,
as exposing ports may grant any user on the internet access to your database.

If you want to quickly spin up and test gnucash-web, then a sample GnuCash database is 
[provided](sample/sample.sqlite) for the SQLite version.

The Docker version runs the [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) WSGI server.

### Initialising database

*GnuCash Web* only works on a preexisting database. It is also currently not possible
to create accounts. Therefore, you have to create a database and populate it with an
account hierarchy before you can use *GnuCash Web*.

Preferably, you will use the official GnuCash desktop app to create a new
book. Simply select the appropriate database back end in the *Open*-dialog. You can
also migrate an existing GnuCash XML file to a database using *Save as*. More details
and database considerations can be found in the official [GnuCash
documentation](https://www.gnucash.org/docs/v4/C/gnucash-guide/basics-files1.html).

Alternatively, you can also use *piecash* to create a new book, as is described in
their [example
section](https://piecash.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorial/examples.html#creating-and-opening-gnucash-files).

### Authentication

Currently, there are only two authentication mechanisms supported, `None` and `'passthrough'`.

When using no authentication, anyone can access the web interface and no credentials are
provided to the database host. This is generally only useful when using the sqlite
back end (which does not accept credentials).

When using pass-through authentication, *GnuCash Web* asks for username and password upon login,
which are provided as credentials for the database hosts. They are also stored in an
encrypted session cookie in the users browser. "Logging out" simply deletes the session
cookie.

### CLI

The CLI is called `gnucash-web` and is installed with the PyPi package. Currently, the only 
supported subcommand is `gnucash-web commodities`:
```sh
Usage: gnucash-web commodities [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  list           List all used commodities.
  update_prices  Update prices for all commodities for which it is enabled.
```

You can [add/edit commodities using the GnuCash desktop
app](https://www.gnucash.org/docs/v4/C/gnucash-help/tool-security-edit.html). Make sure to 
enable online quotes updating. Then, `gnucash-web commodities update_prices` will retrieve
daily closing prices from Yahoo Finance (Quandl for currencies). See also the [piecash
documentation](https://piecash.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/piecash.core.commodity.html#piecash.core.commodity.Commodity.update_prices)
of the underlying function.

Contributing
------------

**Development is at an early stage, but contributions are welcome.**

This is (currently) a personal project to play around with and satisfy my own everyday
needs and intellectual curiosity.

Since *GnuCash Web* fulfills my primary use case for it, I don't expect much development
in the near future. However, if anyone is willing to help taking this into a more
feature-rich direction, I am motivated to work on that.

See [Issues](https://github.com/joshuabach/gnucash-web/issues) and
[Milestones](https://github.com/joshuabach/gnucash-web/milestones) for some ideas on how
to get started.

Related Work
------------
There seem to be few other projects in the same direction:

- The GnuCash mailing list(s) has a few results
  - In 2003, [Martin asked about
    this](https://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-user/2003-July/007243.html) and
    was recommended to to use SSH+X-Forwarding to access his GnuCash database
    remotely.
  - In 2005, [Sachin said](https://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-user/2005-July/014163.html)
    they are planning to work on a web interface, but I could find no further results.
  - In 2012, [James
    posted](https://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-user/2012-March/043762.html)
    about his project
    [nylen/gnucash-django](https://github.com/nylen/gnucash-django), but the last
    commit is from 2015.
- The [GnuCash Wiki's
  Wishlist](https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/WishList#Use_through_web_browser) lists the
  use through a web browser (as well as an iPhone-App) as "WONTFIX" (discussion from
  2006/2007).
- In 2016, mikedom722 asked on
  [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GnuCash/comments/3zlel3/gnucash_web_interface_useful/),
  whether anyone would be interested in a web interface (stating that he has one),
  but did not follow up.
- In the same thread, superman279 presents his app [Remote
  GnuCash](https://github.com/justinhunt1223/remotegnucash), but the last commit is
  from 2017 and the website is down.
- The [GnuCash Wiki](https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/GnuCash_and_Mobile_Devices)
  mentions two GnuCash mobile apps, one for iOS and one for Android. The one for
  Android seems to be discontinued (last commit 2020) the one for iOS still has new
  commits in 2022, but its purpose seems to be to export a CSV to be imported in
  GnuCash, rather then writing to the database directly.
- There is
  [alensiljak/gnucash-portfolio-webui](https://github.com/alensiljak/gnucash-portfolio-webui)
  on GitHub, but the README does not clearly state what it does. It seems to be only a
  exporter for certain reports. Anyway, it was archived in 2022, with last commit
  from 2018.

To conclude, all projects in this direction seem to be at most prototypes for playing
around and even those are scarce. The GnuCash dev-team itself doesn't seem to be keen
on providing a real mobile/web alternative, which is perfectly fine and
understandable. I probably wouldn't either if I were them. Luckily, I am not!
